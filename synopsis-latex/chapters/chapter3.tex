	The core module of the system will be written in Python 3.9 and thus a suitable environment along with various modules including but not limited to Scapy. A decently capable VPS (Virtual Private Server) with GNU/Linux Operating System. \\
	The server side of this application will also be written in Python 3.9 using Flask micro framework. This server will not only host the front end of the application but will also serve the core module by exposing API endpoints. Since both core module and server side rely on Python 3.9, they can share the environment on the VPS. The VPS must come installed with a Web Server/Proxy (Nginx/Apache) to be able to serve the application. \\
	The front end of the application will be structured using HTML and programmed using JavaScript. The front end can be hosted from the backend itself and no dedicated server is necessary for it. Bootstrap as a CSS framework will be used to style various components. \\ \ \\
	Server Side:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {VPS in any major cloud provider}
		\item {GNU/Linux OS}
		\item {Python 3.9 environment}
		\item {Active internet connection to host the application}
		\item {Web Server/Proxy (Apache/Nginx)}
	\end{itemize} 
	Client Side:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {Any modern web browser with JavaScript support (E.g. Chromium 80, Firefox 80)}
		\item {Active internet connection to connect to the server}
	\end{itemize}
