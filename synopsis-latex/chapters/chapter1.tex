\chapter{Abstract}
{
	Continuous network monitoring using tools like Wireshark, TCPDump has become the norm of most enterprise networks. Interpreting the dump files produced by these tools requires some level of technical expertise and as well as time, one must scroll through seemingly countless numbers of packets to be able to make sense of it. While tools like Wireshark do provide some level of interpretation it still lacks the ability to extract solid data points from such dump files. In this project we aim to solve this problem by introducing a module that can interpret these dump files and extract solid data points. The output produced by the module would be interpretable even by non-technical people.
