	Business today is driven by data and powered by networks, enterprises these days have large networks and as a result large amounts of data is being transferred. There are stacks that manage large networks and its resources, systems that can provide real time threat protection, advanced firewalls that can protect networks for ingenuine traffic, however, there is a need for a system that can provide the aftermath of network from dump files captured by real time monitoring tools.
	With the dump files there is always a level of technical expertise and generally a lot of time is spent trying to interpret the data. As a result of this overhead, often key data points are missed out that could be valuable to an enterpriseâ€™s network. It is not feasible for a person to sit hours in front of a screen scrolling through an endless list of packets trying to make sense of it. It is not just about the time being spent but also it will lead to human errors; it is also not the fault of the person the very nature of this job is susceptible to errors even for the best of us. The module being developed in this project will help in extracting key data points.
